        <p>Every story has an ending, but I will never forget such a precious time<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Today is June 3rd, 2018, two days after my last exam in LSE. After such a long reviewing period, I gained a totally new understanding towards english-style final. Still can’t believe I am approaching the end of life in LSE so quickly.</p>
<h2 id="Start"><a href="#Start" class="headerlink" title="Start"></a>Start</h2><p>Yesterday when I was looking through Zhihu, Chinese version of quora, I saw a question,”Please describe your experience studying economics in LSE”. One of the Msc economics student said the moment he got the offer he was not so happy because his very first feeling is whether he could graduate from this place or not. Recall the first day I got the offer, maybe I got the same feeling with him. Part of the reason was that at the very beginning, I did not own a single interest in academia, just want to get the degree, then find a decent job. Also, I have heard a lot of rumors like how tough LSE is, after all, it is NO.1 in Economics in Europe, hope there is not much objections.(Actually after 1yr study I would say yes, learning Economics in LSE can be very tough but you can find some pleasure by focusing on studies, forgetting about all other things like finding jobs, which, is not what I expect at the beginning)</p>
<p>Anyway, I chose LSE because it is a renowned university(well, at least in Finance and Econ fields) and hopefully this degree could have such a strong signalling effect that could bring me a good job. But things really changed afterwards.</p>
<p>##Life in LSE<br>Msc economics student are required to take one pre-course(Like math camp) EC400 one month before the official registeration. If people fail in that course, you have to either switch to other program(if the program director decides to accept you) or take additional math surgery. In that month, we had lectures and classes from 9am to 6pm, seldom some time to relax. Those are basically some introduction about what math techiniques you are going to use the whole year. I have to admit that I was totally overwhelmed at first, and extremelly worried about my result because I don’t deem myself a good student at math. Not to mention the peer pressure. EME took EC451, which is a totally different course(also in main modules, they do totally different courses and classed with us), and from 2017, Msc economics are not allowed to transfer to EME anymore. So don’t ask me anything about EME because I can’t help. </p>
<p>Actually I have considered to switch programs like Finance and Accounting &amp; Finace because to be honest, because they are more related with my career goal. But I failed because of either no quota or no background in accounting. So I had to stick to Msc econ program. Still don’t know if it is a good thing or bad looking back one year later.</p>
<p>Luckily finally I passed that exam and officially start my master life. To be a Msc econ student, you have to 3 compulsory courses like EC411Micro, EC413Macro, EC402Econometrics(All advanced level alothough no indication from the names) and you can choose one optional module from both economics department or finance department. I choose the combo of FM431 corp finance+FM421 applied corp finance, where I met a really really wonderful professor and find some fun.</p>
<p>At the first semester, I was extremely not used to the life style here. There is a huge time difference between China and UK, but my family and most of my friends are in China. So when the night falls, I felt lonely, at the beginning. (Although could still talk to friends in North America) This is the first lesson I learn. Also, I felt a lot of pain switching from a Chinese style of learning to western style (British style here specifically, because I know there is also a huge difference with American style), and from a undergraduate style to graduate level. It looked like things I have learned during my undergrad helps really a little. Especially for Econometrics, looks like this I am leaning a totally different thing. So I felt totally blank about what the professors say. That made me extremely stressful. In my 22yrs life before, I was deemed as a good student(especially before college entrance exam), I have never encountered such a time when I should be worried whether I could get a degree or not. And I didn’t try to find help from TA or professors by going to office hours during the first 6 weeks of MT(first term), because back in mailand China, we don’t have such a system, everyone just learn by their own. I made that choice because I was not used to this kind of system as well as I have such kind of useless self-respect saying I didn’t need additional help. This was a totally wrong decision from the view 9 months later. </p>
<p>At last few weeks in MT, I finally began to go to some TA’s office hours and started formed the habit of seeking for some help whenever I had some problems ever since, which is really helpful. It’s always good to see something from others’ eyes. Still remember the time when solving problems by collaboration with dearest classmates in OH because TA hadn’t looked at the problem before and couldn’t offer some insights instaneously. This really encouraged me and made up one of the best memories in LSE.</p>
<p>Well, I would say I am not a born economist, among all courses I studied, I like FM431+FM421 most(maybe partly because it is more masterable). Actually for FM421, we are required to hand in a related dissertation before the end of the ST. I chose Prof Agrawal’s session and he really gave me a lot of inspiration. I would say he just had the magic to turn something medicore(that’s what I thought towards my topic) into magic. I wouldn’t say how nice my paper(highly probably still some academic shit from the eyes of prof) is but I do have some fun by this kind of logic training, finding something contradictory to the theory I was thinking and thought all best possibilities. Ashiwini is really a good professor that he also offered me some invaluable suggestions in my life, and helped me a lot. I would say I am really really grateful.</p>
<p>I would also like to specially mention Wouter here, who teaches us Macro in Lent term. He is such a workholic. Usually professors would only have one OH one week but he has two. In LT, we had this special forum where people can post their questions anonymously. I was so surprised that Wouter can always respond within hours. I learned so much by looking through questions others posted and also tried to post several questions myself. The thing that Wouter kept saying time over time is “You should think by yourself, thinking by yourself can be very painful but it is a really important thing.”(Maybe “the beauty of economics is that simple intuition can give you a lot of information” hahaha) So he kept asking us if…then what? I have to admit such kind of training can be very torturing, but I did learn a lot by it. (Somehow I link this to what Ashiwini told us every lecture, that is, when we are learning something, we should first think what is the question, who cares and why don’t we know the answer already.) Wouter said on his forum that in the summer, after all the exams, we will miss macro. Now I feel like I truly am.<br>(BTW, sth not so important: When I was preparing for Macro exam, when I felt boring I would open up Wouter’s personal website:<a href="http://www.wouterdenhaan.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.wouterdenhaan.com/</a>, link is attached. This is so special and bring me a lot of fun hahaha. Don’t turn off the sound or you will regret. Wouter is such an interesting guy.)</p>
<p>So learning economics in LSE really help me to form the big picture of Economics and now when I want to learn something I would first ask what, why do we care and how can we address this problem first. This means so much to me personally. </p>
<h2 id="Life-in-London"><a href="#Life-in-London" class="headerlink" title="Life in London"></a>Life in London</h2><p>I would say the first day I arrived at London, I hated it, it was a place that means no friends, no entertaiment, but only endless obscure slides as well as homework to me. But now, truly, I felt in love with the city. I really appreciate things happened within the year. </p>
<p>I would say although as the leaving time approaching very soon, I still haven’t explore London much. But when I visit museums in London, when I travel to Royal Observatory, when I hang out in parks, I felt like it’s a place full of charm.</p>
<p>Also, I want to especially say thank you to my meal pals. As picky in eating as I am, I am not good at cooking.(Actually I hardly ever cooked before I move to London) But my meal pals are really excellent cook. Usually we would have some small gathering inside our hall and everyone should bring his or her own cuisine(not sure if this is a right word). This really encouraged me to learn to cook. And also miss the time when we had our little talks afterwards till midnight.  So, thanks for being lenient with my terrible cooking skills and having those hours with me. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<h2 id="The-end"><a href="#The-end" class="headerlink" title="The end"></a>The end</h2><p>Actually I can’t officially call it the end because I just finished my exams and haven’t got the resuly. Hopefully all the best.</p>
<p>I am confident that LSE has indeed bring me some lifetime changes but now I am still not sure what those could be.</p>
<p>Not sure if any of my friends from LSE will see this. Maybe Yulia will, I have a feeling she’s a good programmer. Sorry disqus can’t be enabled under this theme. Sorry for can’t make it to take a group picture with you guys. Wish you all the best in the future.</p>
